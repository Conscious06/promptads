# PromptAds - Product Brief

## What is PromptAds?

PromptAds is an **AI-native advertising network** for LLM (Large Language Model) applications. It enables app developers to monetize their AI-powered applications through native, context-aware advertisements that appear within conversations.

## The Problem

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **LLM apps can't monetize** | Traditional ads (banners, popups) don't work in conversation interfaces |
| **Low conversion** | Users ignore interruptive ads - CTR < 0.5% |
| **No native solution** | Existing ad networks weren't designed for AI/chat interfaces |
| **Development cost** | Building monetization from scratch is expensive |

---

## Our Solution

Native ads that appear **inside** LLM responses - not as interruptions, but as relevant suggestions.

### How It Works

```
1. User asks something → "How do I start a conversation on a first date?"
2. LLM generates response → "Start with open-ended questions..."
3. PromptAds analyzes → "This is a dating question - show relevant ad"
4. Ad appears naturally → "💡 Try AI Dating Coach - personalized tips"
```
